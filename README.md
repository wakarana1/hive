# HIVE

Are you tired of squinting up at the projector to see the code your instructor is writing? Do you have questions that your instructor told you to hold onto only to forget it when it's time to ask? HIVE code editor was created with instructors and students in mind. With real time coding, you can watch your instructor code on your own screen and never have to squint up at the projector screen again! Post it up on the question board for your instructor to see and they can answer it during the lesson!
